# Level Design tools

## Road track for racing
* Used De Casteljau cubic bezier curve algorithm to build 3D path for a level.
* Using a flat plain mesh, procedurally extruded along its right axis to the path of curve with equal sample segments.

## Trace path for strokes
* Used cubic bezier curve to build 2D path on the screen for user to trace on it.
* Used next derivation of the curve and compared it with the direction of the user input drag to progress on tracing.
